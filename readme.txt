Basic program that grabs and dumps configs for cisco ios devices.

Requires Python 3.12 (LTS Microsoft Store Works!)
Install requirements by opening a terminal in the directory and running:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


Reads from text files to populate a list to grab the configs. 
Format is as such:
10.0.250.0
10.0.250.1
10.0.250.2

Do not add the extension to the text file.

(For now only grabs. Run menu.py to get going!)
